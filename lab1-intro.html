    <h1>Hey, Welcome!</h1>

    <p>We will be building web pages using current technologies including but not limited to HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), 
        and JavaScript. The focus on the course is developing a foundation in web programming. The prerequisite for this class was
        IT Concepts for Programmers. I hope it brings me glory to the tech world.

    <p>I'm excited to learn <strong>Programming</strong> this semester.</p>
